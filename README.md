# Module One Challenge

## Project Overview

This project challenged us to refactor an existing codebase for a Marketing Agency looking to follow accessibilty standards to improve their website's Search Engine Optimization.

## Brief / Acceptance Criteria

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

## Technologies Used

HTML
CSS
VS Code 
Git and GitHub

## Wins / Key Learnings
The biggest win for me was learning how to create classes and use loops to get rid of repetive code. It taught the importance of making code accessible, adding alt texts to images and most impoartantly, how to optimize and leave an existing codebase cleaner than received.
